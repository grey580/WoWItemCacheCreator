# WoWItemCacheCreator
This program I slapped together will go and download the World of Warcraft game items. 
This data can be saved locally or in a database.

To run this program successfully you will need an API Key from Blizzard.

After you register and get your key. Paste the key into the API Key box. Select a folder to save the results to. And click Run.

This will take some time to run since there are a lot of items in the wow db.

But once completed you will have json files with detailed information. Plus an sql file with inserts for a db. 

Modify the code to your liking.

Good luck.
